# UK_Crime_Spark
This repository is for testing few claims made in a the television documentary “Ross Kemp and the Armed Police” broadcasted on 6th September 2018 by ITV about crime issues in UK. This is the final assignment under 'Big Data and Cloud Computing' module in Northumbria University, New Castle, UK. This task has been originally done by me on 2010-2018 dataset containing 19 million observations. However, computations on only 2018 dataset is included in this repository because of some reasons.
