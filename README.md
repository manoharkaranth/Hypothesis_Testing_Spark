# UK_Crime_Spark
This repository is for testing a few claims made in a television documentary “Ross Kemp and the Armed Police” broadcasted on 6th September 2018 by ITV about crime issues in UK. This task has been originally done by me on 2010-2018 dataset containing 19 million observations. However, computations on only 2018 dataset is included in this repository because of some reasons.<br/>
